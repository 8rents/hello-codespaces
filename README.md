## Using vscode.dev as an IDE

We will use GitHub as a file system and vscode.dev as an IDE

1. Create a new repository on GitHub
    - Add a Name (mine's called `hello-codespaces`)
    - Add a description
    - Add a README
    - Add a license
    - Add a Node GitIgnore to the Repo
2. In your browser open <https://vscode.dev>
    - Sign in with GitHub and/or Microsoft
    - Open the GitHub Repo you just made
    - Type any additional documentation into the README.md file
    - Commit and push the "initial commit"
    - When you refresh your github repo in your browser we will see the changes

## Using Codespaces as a development enviornment

1. Open a new terminal window in vscode
2. Click the "continue working in GitHub Codespaces" button
3. Authorize Codespaces
4. Select the type of server you want to spin up
5. A new window will open with a terminal
6. Test that node is installed `node -v` prints out `v20.17.0`

## Create a new node app

In the codespaces terminal initalize a new node app `package.json` file  by running `npm init` and adjusting any of the settings.

> ### *A couple of notes about `package.json` file creation*
>
> *You can auto create a `package.json` file using `npm init -y`, however this will not create all of the options in the json array.*
>
> *You can select the default by hitting enter for each question.* ***This is better than the `-y` flag because each of the array options will be created for you.*** *You won't have to look up each of the correct key values later.*
