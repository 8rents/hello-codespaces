# hello-codespaces

> *An attempt at ephemeral computing by developing purely in the cloud using GitHub codespaces and vscode.dev to make a quick start node.js app*

---

## Getting Started

We will use GitHub as a file system and vscode.dev as an IDE

1. Create a new repository on GitHub
    - Add a Name (mine's called `hello-codespaces`)
    - Add a description
    - Add a README
    - Add a license
    - Add a Node GitIgnore to the Repo
2. In Your Browser Open <https://vscode.dev>
    - Sign in with GitHub and/or Microsoft
    - Open the GitHub Repo you just made
    - Type any additional documentation into the README.md file
    - Commit and push the "initial commit"
